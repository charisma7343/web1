  <h2>ABA Verbal Behavior 이란 무엇인가</h2>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.bfskinner.org/product/verbal-behavior-pdf/"
  target="_blank" title="verbal behavior specification">Skinner</a>(1938/1966)</strong>
  argued that the analysis of <u>operant behavior</u> "with its
  unique relation to the environ¬ment presents a separate important field of investigation" (p. 438).
  He named this new science the experimental analysis of behavior and outlined the methodology for its
  practice. Simply put, Skinner recorded the rate at which a single subject (he initially used rats and
  later, pi¬geons) emitted a given behavior in a controlled and stan¬dardized experimental chamber.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:30px;">The first set of data Skinner presented in The Be¬havior of Organisms was
  a graph that "gives a record
  of the resulting change in behavior" (p. 67) when a food pellet was delivered immediately after a rat
  pressed a lever (see Figure 1 1) Skinner noted that the first three times that food followed a response
  "had no observable effect" but that "the fourth response was followed by an appreciable increase in rate
  showing a swift acceleration to a maximum" (pp. 67-68).</p></body></html>
